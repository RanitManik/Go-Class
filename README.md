# Go Language Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning the Go programming language. As a student of Matt Holiday's *Go Class* on YouTube, I am documenting my progress with code snippets, notes, and insights from each class. This is a hands-on approach to understanding the core concepts of Go and applying them through small projects and exercises.
