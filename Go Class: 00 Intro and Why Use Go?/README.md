## Why Go?

### Philosophy
- **Designed by:** Creators of Unix & C.
- **Rob Pike's Quote:** "Go is about language design in the service of software engineering."
- **Programming vs. Engineering:**
    - *Clever* is a compliment in programming.
    - *Clever* is an accusation in engineering.

---

### Simplicity
- **Key Principle:** Programs are for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute (Harold Abelson).
- **Tony Hoare's Quote:** A complicated language is part of the problem, not the solution.

---

### Design Goals
- Combine simplicity, safety, and readability with efficiency and safety of statically typed, compiled languages.
- Goals:
    - Simplicity and readability.
    - Ease of algorithm expression.
    - Orthogonality.
    - One right way to do things.

---

### Compactness
- **Eleanor McHugh's Quote:** "I can mostly hold the spec in my head."
- **Proverb:** "Clear is better than clever."

---

## Why Was Go Created?

### The Need for a New Language
- Adapts to:
    - Multicore processors.
    - Networked systems.
    - Massive clusters.
    - REST-based web programming.
    - Huge programs and teams.
    - Long build times.

---

### Comparison with Older Languages
- Concurrency was an afterthought in:
    - JavaScript (1995), Python (1991), Java (1995), C# (2000), C++ (1983), and C (1972).

---

## Built for the Cloud
- Dominates infrastructure/container/cloud tools:
    - Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Drone, Rancher.
    - Prometheus, Grafana, CoreOS, CockroachDB, DropBox, CloudFlare.

---

### Advantages of Go
- Speed and robustness of a compiled, statically-typed language.
- Clear expression of concurrent solutions.
- Consistent styling with `gofmt`.
- Minimal sacrifice in functionality.

---

### Final Thought
- **Dennis Ritchie's Quote:** "A language that doesnâ€™t have everything is actually easier to program in than some that do."
